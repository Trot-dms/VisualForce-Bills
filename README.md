# VisualForce-Bills

Simple VF app that allows to guest users to log in based on Contact data. 
No user licenses are needed. This is only for learning. In real case scenario use oauth for login users.

This app looks similar to my bills app made in Java. There is no other functionality for now.

To login use email : tripley@uog.com, next click to generate key and use this key to login. If login is locked, use force logout.
